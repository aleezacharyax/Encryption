Sure! Here's a detailed and clean **README.md** for your Hill Cipher File Encryption/Decryption project using a Java HTTP server and HTML/JS frontend:

---

```markdown
# üîê Hill Cipher File Encryption/Decryption Web App

This is a simple web application that allows users to upload text files and encrypt or decrypt them using the **Hill Cipher** algorithm. The backend is a Java HTTP server, and the frontend is written in HTML and JavaScript.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

```

HillCipher/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.java                 # Hill Cipher logic: encryption, decryption, and matrix operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FileCipherServer.java   # Java HTTP server handling multipart form requests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Simple frontend UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js               # JavaScript for handling file uploads and responses
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css               # Optional styles

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1. Compile and Start the Server

Make sure you're in the folder with `App.java` and `FileCipherServer.java`.

```bash
javac App.java FileCipherServer.java
java FileCipherServer
````

Server will start at:
üìç `http://localhost:8080`

---

### 2. Launch the Frontend

You can open the frontend using a local file server or directly from your file system.

#### Option A: Open from File Explorer

* Open `index.html` in your browser.
* Example: `file:///Users/yourname/HillCipher/index.html`

#### Option B: Use Live Server (VS Code or Python)

Using Python:

```bash
cd HillCipher
python3 -m http.server 5500
```

Then go to:
üìç `http://localhost:5500/index.html`

---

## ‚úÖ Features

* Upload any `.txt` file
* Input a 3x3 Hill Cipher key matrix
* Choose to Encrypt or Decrypt
* Download the processed file as `output.txt`

---

## üß† Hill Cipher Key Format

Matrix format (must be 3x3), comma-separated:

```
6,24,1;
13,16,10;
20,17,15
```

Each row is separated by `;`, and each number by `,`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

* Java 8 or higher
* Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

---

## üß™ Test Example

Try this in browser console:

```js
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append("file", new Blob(["HELLO"], { type: "text/plain" }), "test.txt");
formData.append("keyMatrix", "6,24,1;13,16,10;20,17,15");

fetch("http://localhost:8080/encrypt", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData
})
.then(r => r.blob())
.then(blob => {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  window.open(url); // shows output
});
```

---

## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

* Ensure Java server is running before submitting the form
* Use valid 3x3 matrix for Hill Cipher
* Browser must allow localhost communication (disable extensions if blocked)
